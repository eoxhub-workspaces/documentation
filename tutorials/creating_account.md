5\. Keep in mind that not all EOxHub workspaces will automatically authorize your account. Sometimes you may have to wait to be approved by an administrator. Once you have completed all of that, you have successfully created an EOxHub account. Feel free to take a look at our other tutorials in order to understand how to utilize our tools.
