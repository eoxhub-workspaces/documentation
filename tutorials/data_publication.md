# Data Publication

To support the presentation of datasets, EOxHub includes a publishing layer that leverages tools such as [eodash](https://eodash.org/). Operators can describe their datasets using structured JSON Schema based forms, which are translated into STAC metadata and managed via a Git-based flow/.

This approach allows updates to be reviewed, versioned, and automatically reflected in the workspace data catalogs.
