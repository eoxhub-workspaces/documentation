# Conda Store

Within each user workspace where JupyterLab is provisioned is also a dedicated [conda-store](https://conda.store/). 


Conda store enables users to define and manage reproducible Python environments. This ensures consistent execution across sessions and allows developers to control the underlying libraries and dependencies for their workflows.

Conda store supports GUI or yaml syntax for environment creation and examples and how to guides can be found in official [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
