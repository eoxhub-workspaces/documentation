# Data Editor

Data Editor application, provides a traceable review and approval path of collection configurations before data is published to [eodash](https://eodash.org) STAC catalog.
It is based on [git-clerk](https://github.com/EOX-A/git-clerk) - Open-Source Content Management System based on Git workflows with a friendly file-editing GUI.

It enables workspace owners to describe their datasets using simple forms, validate them against JSON schema definitions, and commit them via Git-based sessions.

## Supported data types
Currently supported data (resource) types are: 

* Raw sources:
  * COG source
  * GeoJSON source
  * FlatGeobuf source
* SentinelHub
* SentinelHub WMS
* GeoDB
* GeoDB Vector Tile
* WMS
* VEDA - Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis
* XCube Server
* Copernicus Marine Data Store WMTS


List of all supported resources is kept up to date on [eodash wiki](https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog/wiki/Resource) so please visit this site as well. 



## Required information

All required fields are marked in the Data Editor. More information about each of the fields is available on the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog/wiki)

## Overview of the process

Generally for including a supported type of EO collection into a eodash deployed within EOxHub, the steps are summarized as follows:

- Start a new `session` in the Data Editor and create a new collection configuration file.
- Fill metadata fields split into thematic groups. Mainly filling the [Resource](https://github.com/eodash/eodash_catalog/wiki/Resource) is important to visualize the data on the web map.
- For raw data and client only rendering (GeoJSON, flatgeobuf or GeoTIFF as direct access), eodash supports an [OpenLayers flatstyle](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_flat.html). More information on styling can be [found here](https://eodash.org/data.html#vector-data).
- eodash project offers [eodash-style-editor](https://github.com/eodash/eodash-style-editor) for editing the flatstyle definitions with updating the visualization in real time when definition is changed
- To define interactions for the user (e.g. modify the style within the eodash app), the style can be extended with variables, combined with [JSON Form definition](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-jsonform--docs).
- After finishing the updates confirmed by the layer live preview panel and approving of the corresponding Data editing session (GitHub Pull Request), the changes can be merged to production catalog.
