JupyterLab environment

Within each user workspace, JupyterLab is provisioned with a dedicated [conda-store](https://conda.store/) support, enabling users to define and manage reproducible Python environments. This ensures consistent execution across sessions and allows developers to control the underlying libraries and dependencies for their workflows.
