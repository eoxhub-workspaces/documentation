# File Browser

The **File Browser** is a web-based file management application integrated into the EOxHub Workspace, enabling users to efficiently upload, organize, and manage geospatial data assets. Built upon the [Versioneer Tech Package-R](https://github.com/versioneer-tech/package-r), it offers a streamlined interface for interacting with datasets within the workspace.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean, intuitive interface for navigating and managing files.
- **Folder Structure Management**: Allows users to create, rename, and organize folders to structure their data effectively.
- **File Operations**: Supports standard file operations such as upload, download, delete, and move, facilitating efficient data management.
- **Metadata Integration**: Enables the association of metadata with files, enhancing data discoverability and context.



## Public Access System

EOxHub Workspace employs a public access system to facilitate sharing and accessing datasets:

- **Public Folder**: Files placed in the `public` directory are accessible via permanent public URLs, allowing for easy sharing and integration into other applications e.g. [Data Editor](data_editor).
- **Shareable Links**: Users can generate shareable links for specific files or folders, providing controlled access to external collaborators.
- **Access Control**: All areas within the File Browser are restricted to be accessed only by users of the workspace. Data in the `public` folder is openly accessible, but only if someone knows the path and name of the file, it is not possible to list the content. By using the creation of shareable links other files can be made accessible to external people.
