## Public Access System

EOxHub Workspace employs a public access system to facilitate sharing and accessing datasets:

- **Public Folder**: Files placed in the `public` directory are accessible via permanent public URLs, allowing for easy sharing and integration into other applications.
- **Shareable Links**: Users can generate shareable links for specific files or folders, providing controlled access to external collaborators.
- **Access Control**: While the `public` folder is openly accessible, other areas of the File Browser have restricted access based on user permissions, ensuring data security.
